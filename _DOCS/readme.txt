== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is it possible to use CSS to style the summarizer? =

Yes, since version 1.4.1 it is possible. I set the surrounding div tag to use the css class
"link-summarizer". For details see the included file style.css.sample. At the moment the html tags used are h3, ul and li.

= Is it possible to decide if the URL or the link text get shown in the summary? =

Yes, this is also a new feature included in 1.4.1. In the Admin panel there's an option for it.

= I have special design needs. =

Starting with version 1.5 the design of the output the pluging produces is completely configurable in the admin interface
